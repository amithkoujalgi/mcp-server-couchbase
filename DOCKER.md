# Couchbase MCP Server

Pre-built images for the [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) MCP Server.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI agents to interact with Couchbase databases.

Github Repo: https://github.com/Couchbase-Ecosystem/mcp-server-couchbase

Dockerfile: https://github.com/Couchbase-Ecosystem/mcp-server-couchbase/blob/main/Dockerfile

## Features

- Get a list of all the buckets in the cluster
- Get a list of all the scopes and collections in the specified bucket
- Get a list of all the scopes in the specified bucket
- Get a list of all the collections in a specified scope and bucket. Note that this tool requires the cluster to have Query service.
- Get the structure for a collection
- Get a document by ID from a specified scope and collection
- Upsert a document by ID to a specified scope and collection
- Delete a document by ID from a specified scope and collection
- Run a [SQL++ query](https://www.couchbase.com/sqlplusplus/) on a specified scope
  - Queries are automatically scoped to the specified bucket and scope, so use collection names directly (e.g., use `SELECT * FROM users` instead of `SELECT * FROM bucket.scope.users`)
  - There is an option in the MCP server, `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_QUERY_MODE` that is set to true by default to disable running SQL++ queries that change the data or the underlying collection structure. Note that the documents can still be updated by ID.
- Get the status of the MCP server
- Check the cluster credentials by connecting to the cluster
- List all indexes in the cluster with their definitions, with optional filtering by bucket, scope, collection and index name.
- Get index recommendations from Couchbase Index Advisor for a given SQL++ query to optimize query performance
- Get cluster health status and list of all running services
- Query performance analysis tools using:
  - Get longest running queries by average service time
  - Get most frequently executed queries
  - Get queries with the largest response sizes
  - Get queries with the largest result counts
  - Get queries that use a primary index (potential performance concern)
  - Get queries that don't use a covering index
  - Get queries that are not selective (index scans return many more documents than final result)

## Usage

The Docker images can be used in the supported MCP clients such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc in combination with Docker.
